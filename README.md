# Synerise PHP SDK

---

## About
[Synerise](https://www.synerise.com) SDK for PHP. Allows access to Synerise APIs and overall integration.

## Requirements
* A Synerise workspace API Key
* PHP 7.4+

## Installing Synerise SDK with Composer

SDK is available over packagist. Some dependencies are optional and can be replaced with custom implementations 

1. You can install it with the following command:

```shell
composer require synerise/php-sdk
```

2. Install suggested dependencies
```shell
composer require mobiledetect/mobiledetectlib
```

## Initialization

The repository provides autogenerated api clients that can be utilized on their own.
There's also a single entry point `ClientBuilder` which helps to initialize and authorized all the apis.

### Using ClientBuilder

`ClientBuilder` requires a `Synerise\Sdk\Api\Config` implementation, which would contain the set of api settings.

1. Initializing the api with `ClientBuilder`:

```php
use Synerise\Sdk\Api\ClientBuilder;
use Synerise\Sdk\Api\Config;

/** @var Config $config implementation of Config interface */
$clientBuilder = new ClientBuilder($config);
```

2. Optionally you can also provide your own RequestAdapter:
```php
use Microsoft\Kiota\Abstractions\RequestAdapter;
use Synerise\Sdk\Api\ClientBuilder;
use Synerise\Sdk\Api\Config;

/** 
 * @var Config $config implementation of Config interface 
 * @var RequestAdapter $requestAdapter implementation of RequestAdapter interface
 */
$clientBuilder = new ClientBuilder($config, $requestAdapter);
```
